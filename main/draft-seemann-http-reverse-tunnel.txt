2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Definition

3.1.  HTTP/1.1

   HTTP/1.1 uses the HTTP ugprade mechanism (see Section 7.4 of
   [HTTP-SEMANTICS]).

   This document defines the "reverse" upgrade token.  The method of the
   request SHALL be "GET".  The server accepts the request with a 101
   (Switching Protocols) response.  Accepting the upgrade reverses the
   roles of client and server.

   GET /reverse-http HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Connection: upgrade
   Upgrade: reverse

   HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
   Connection: upgrade
   Upgrade: reverse

4.  Security Considerations

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Upgrade Token Registration

   The following entry is added to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) Upgrade Token Registry" registry established by Section 16.7
   of [HTTP-SEMANTICS].

   The "reverse-tunnel" label identifies HTTP/3 used as a protocol for
   the Reverse Tunnel:

   Value:  reverse-tunnel
